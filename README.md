# Timestamping the web


On 1 November 2025, the creator of Ubikron, Roelof Temmingh (https://www.linkedin.com/in/roeloftemmingh/), gave a presentation entitled Timestamping the web at the OSINTCon conference (https://osintconference.com/).


> Everything online has a timestamp, just not where you expect it. This session dives into metadata and artifact analysis across modern websites to reveal how hidden temporal fingerprints expose when something truly came into being. It’s about restoring order to digital entropy — finding the clock the web tries to conceal.
